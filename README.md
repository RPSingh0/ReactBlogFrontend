## How to prepare this for GitHub pages

* Install `gh-pages` with following command and save as dev dependency

```bash
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

* Now, head to `package.json` and the following at top

```json
{
  ...
  "homepage": "https://<github-user-name>.github.io/<repository-name>/",
  ...
}
```

* And add the following to the scripts (since we're using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) for our application, we'll
  be using deploy command with `dist` instead of `build`)

```json
{
  ...
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",
  ...
}
```

* Now, head to `vite.config.js` and add the following in config

```json
{
  ...
  "base": "/<repository-name>/",
  ...
}
```

* One last change üòÅ, if you're using BrowserRouter with react-route, Github doesn't support that as of now, so go ahead
  to your imports and change

```js
import {

...,
HashRouter,
...
}
from
"react-router-dom";
```

* And use `HashRouter` in place of `BrowserRoute`

```jsx
<HashRouter>
    ...
</HashRouter>
```

### After all the steps above, save all of your code and run the following command

```bash
npm run deploy
```

* This will do the following things
    * Build the project and put the built files under `dist` directory
    * Reach out to github and create/update the build files under the branch `gh-pages`
    * Once you see `Published` in your console, it's all done!

### Now go to Github under the following path

* `github` -> `repository` -> `settings` -> `pages`
* And ensure that `gh-pages` is selected as deploy under `Build and deployment` section and `source` is set
  to `Deploy from a branch`
* After a few minutes, you'll be able to see the url for your site ü•≥
